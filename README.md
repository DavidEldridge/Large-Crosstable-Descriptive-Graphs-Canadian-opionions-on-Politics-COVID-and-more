# Large-Crosstable-Descriptive-Graphs-Canadian-opionions-on-Politics-COVID-and-more
This was a project for an ongoing application to a consulting compoany. I was tasked with creating two graphs to showcase how comfortable each age group in Canada felt about resuming normal activities in the time of COVID 19 (this is the first chunk), as well as creating large crosstables calculating response types to each question based on demographic variables (the rest!). 
README: Pretty simple, excel file is the data set and .RMD file is the R mark down code
